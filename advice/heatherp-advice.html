			<h4>The internet is your friend!</h4>
			<p>And like a good friend, there is a lot of free advice. Take advantage of all the webiverse has to offer. Even if you stumble upon some bad advice, you will learn from that experience. And you will most likely never use it again.</p>

			<h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
			<p>The more you do a task, the more it will become second nature. Even though you are getting kick ass tutorials from Skillcrush, it is also helpful to play around with one of the free coding sites on the internet. It's like extra curricular activities to boost your knowledge. Plus if you already know how to do what the free tutorial is teaching, you feel like a smarty pants.  </p>
